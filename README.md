# Planetmint Refinement Proposals (PRPs)

This repository is the home of all Planetmint Refinement Proposals (PRPs), along with ideas for new ones and discussions around proposed or existing ones. This set of RPRs are partly derived from it predecessors, the (BigchainDB Enhancement Proposals(9))[https://github.com/bigchaindb/PRPs]

The process to add or change a PRP is the following:

- The PRP life-cycle SHOULD follow the life-cycle defined in [PRP-2 (our variant of COSS)](./2).
- Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on [Raw](./2#raw-PRPs) and [Draft](./2#draft-PRPs) specifications.
